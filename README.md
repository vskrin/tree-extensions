# Some useful extensions of scikit-learn DecisionTreeClassifier

## Abstract

This set of modules contains some useful extension of the standard scikit-learn decision tree classifier.

Each extension is found in a separate Python module, and each extension has one accompanying testing module for demonstration.

The extensions are:
* "bumper" algorithm
* leaf report
* visualization of decision boundaries for two top-most splits
* visualization of decision boundaries projected on the space of two principal components (two leading PCA components)

## Bumper
Bumper algorithm is briefly explained in ...
Bumper class can be found in ... module. It was written by borrowing (heavily) from [this](...) resource. 

## Leaf report
Shows leaf probabilities for target (non-target) class. Can be used for ....

## Decision boundaries at the tree-top
Implementation in Plotly...
Can be embedded in ...

## Decision boundaries in PCA space
Useful for qualitative estimation of tree performance ...
